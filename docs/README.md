# emaki docs

emaki is a Wayland desktop shell for niri: a status bar, a dock, the launcher,
notifications, Quick Settings and desktop widgets, the apps beside them, and **emaki-kit**
(`crates/kit/`), the look as a library that the shell and its apps share. It sits on two forks:

    shell["emaki (this repo)<br/>apps/shell the shell, crates/kit emaki-kit, apps/ the programs beside it"]
    amane["amane fork<br/>Rust UI library: layer windows, popups, services, blur regions"]
    niri["niri fork<br/>compositor: materials, blur shapes, vibrancy, the desktop layer, gesture IPC"]
    shell -->|"Cargo git dependency"| amane
    amane -->|"Wayland protocols + niri IPC"| niri
```

- niri fork: <https://github.com/098765434/niri> (branch `ocbk`); what it adds:
  [docs/fork/README.md](https://github.com/098765434/niri/blob/ocbk/docs/fork/README.md). Not the shell's, but part of the same desktop: the workspace
  mat, a backing niri paints behind the scrolling layout's windows ([layout/workspace-mat.md](https://github.com/098765434/niri/blob/ocbk/docs/fork/layout/workspace-mat.md)).
- amane fork: <https://github.com/098765434/amane> (branch `ocbk`); what it adds:
  [docs/fork/README.md](https://github.com/098765434/amane/blob/ocbk/docs/fork/README.md).

A feature's docs live where its code lives: these docs link to the forks' rather than repeat
them. How the four repositories pin each other is in [STACK.md](../STACK.md).

The docs are in two halves. `user/` is for someone running the desktop: installing it, setting
it up, and what each surface does. `developer/` is for someone changing it: the architecture,
the kit, the integration points, testing and releasing. The [README](../README.md) is the front
page; contributing is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Words

The docs use one name for each thing:

- **Emaki Settings** is the settings app; its program is `emaki-settings`, named once per doc.
- **Quick Settings** is the panel of controls in the bar.
- A **status app** is a program that puts something in the bar; its **status item** is what shows
  there.
- The **notification center** is written in lowercase.
- **color**, in American spelling (the code's `Color` too).
- Features are named for what they are ("the launcher", "glass"), never with another vendor's
  platform terms; `scripts/lint-terms` checks it.
